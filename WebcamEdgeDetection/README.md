![Demo of Webcam Edge Detection](https://github.com/kedaraman/DeepLearningComputerVisionUdemy/master/blob/WebcamEdgeDetection/Demo.PNG)

Above is a model of what the webcam edge detection project is supposed to do. Using a Gaussian Blur to reduce noise and Canny edge detection, this program takes live video from the user's webcam and creates a sketch of the video. This program uses features from OpenCV 2.
